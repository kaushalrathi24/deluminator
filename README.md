# deluminator

### Premise

Ever stuck in a crowd, unable to find your friends? Attending a conference but can't find the booth of your choice?

Wanted your own personal deluminator, illuminating the path towards your destination, just like it did for Ronald Weasley. 

We have the perfect app for you, your own personal beacon. 

### About the Idea

This app presents a street-view-esque navigation system with an AR compass overlay on top of your camera viewfinder. When you open your app it presents to you all your friends/public booths available in your vicinity

You can select any one freind , the bubble comes to the forefront with a navigation arrow and a map pointing at the correct direction. There would also be a videogame-esque pinging system where a virtual placeholder will be on said booth/person with distance present next to it. We will also have simple chat functionality with common navigation prompts. For privacy concerns, you will be able to access the location of only those friends who have pinged, whereas public booths will beacon to everyone.
